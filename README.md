Employee Turnover Prediction

Overview
Employee turnover can be a significant challenge for organizations, resulting in loss of talent, knowledge, and productivity. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts employee turnover based on historical data.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 10,000 rows and 15 columns, including features such as employee demographics, job characteristics, and historical turnover data.

Methodology
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Feature engineering: Creating new features that capture relevant information.
3. Model selection: Comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters using cross-validation and grid search.

Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 92.5% and an F1-score of 91.2%. The most important features contributing to the prediction were employee age, job satisfaction, and tenure.
